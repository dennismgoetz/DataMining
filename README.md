# Data Mining
This project was part of the "Data Mining" course at the University of Trento.

## Project description
A company is responsible for delivering different kinds of merchandise among different cities. In order to do such a thing, 
it hires drivers to whom assigns specific routes they should follow. For instance; go from Verona to Trento and deliver 
10 apples, then go to Venezia and deliver 4 bananas and 3 pens, etc. The problem resides in the fact that the driver often 
adds and omits cities and merchandise at his will, which causes a considerable discrepancy between what they are told to do 
(standard routes), and what they actually do (actual routes). Our job is to come up with a solution to the following three 
tasks, so that the company can use it to minimize the above discrepancy:
  1. Propose better standard routes
  2. For each driver, sort the existing standard routes depending on his tastes
  3. Propose an ideal standard route for every driver
